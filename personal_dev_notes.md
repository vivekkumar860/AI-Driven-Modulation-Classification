# Personal Development Notes: Modulation Classification App

## Project Overview
- **App Name:** AI-Driven Modulation Classification
- **Repo:** https://github.com/vivekkumar860/AI-Driven-Modulation-Classification
- **Main App:** app.py
- **Model File:** mod_classifier.h5
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Community Cloud

## Contact Info
- **Owner:** Shubham Kumar
- **Email:** your.real.email@domain.com
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/vivekkumar860

## Current Features
- Upload I/Q `.npy` files (single or batch)
- Upload custom Keras `.h5` model
- Interactive visualizations: I/Q waveforms, constellation, class probabilities
- Confusion matrix (if ground truth provided)
- SNR estimation
- Download results/history as CSV
- Dark mode, modern UI

## Future Development Ideas
- [ ] Add REST API endpoint for programmatic predictions
- [ ] Add user authentication for private deployments
- [ ] Add advanced analytics (e.g., SNR histograms, feature importances)
- [ ] Add support for more model formats (e.g., ONNX)
- [ ] Add more signal visualizations (e.g., spectrogram, waterfall)
- [ ] Add model training interface (upload data, train in-browser)
- [ ] Add notifications (email/webhook) on new predictions
- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] Add persistent user history (database)
- [ ] Add Dockerfile for containerized deployment
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Notes
- Use `runtime.txt` to specify Python version for Streamlit Cloud.
- Keep `requirements.txt` minimal for compatibility.
- For large model files, consider external storage or chunked upload.
